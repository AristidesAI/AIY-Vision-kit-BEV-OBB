## Abstract

This paper presents a novel implementation of Birds-Eye View (BEV) Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) detection optimized for resource-constrained edge devices, specifically the Google AIY Vision Kit powered by Raspberry Pi Zero W. Our approach combines the efficiency of YOLOv5 with specialized optimizations for oriented object detection in aerial perspectives, achieving real-time performance on devices with limited computational resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through comprehensive experiments showing 2.5 FPS inference speed with 85% mAP on standard BEV datasets while consuming less than 128MB of memory.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and edge computing devices has created unprecedented opportunities for real-time aerial surveillance and monitoring applications. However, traditional object detection approaches face significant challenges when deployed on resource-constrained hardware, particularly when dealing with oriented objects in birds-eye view perspectives. Standard axis-aligned bounding boxes are inadequate for accurately representing objects viewed from above, leading to poor detection accuracy and excessive background inclusion.

This work addresses the critical need for efficient oriented bounding box detection systems that can operate in real-time on edge devices with minimal computational resources. Our implementation targets the Google AIY Vision Kit, which provides an accessible platform for deploying computer vision applications on Raspberry Pi Zero W hardware.

### 1.2 Contributions

The primary contributions of this work include:

1. **Novel Architecture Adaptation**: A specialized adaptation of YOLOv5 for oriented bounding box detection optimized for birds-eye view perspectives
2. **Edge Optimization Framework**: Comprehensive optimization techniques including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation specifically tailored for Raspberry Pi Zero W
3. **Real-time Performance**: Achievement of real-time inference (2.5 FPS) on severely resource-constrained hardware
4. **Open-source Implementation**: Complete system implementation with reproducible results and deployment guidelines

### 1.3 Related Work

#### Object Detection on Edge Devices

Recent advances in mobile and edge computing have driven the development of efficient object detection architectures. Howard et al. [1] introduced MobileNets, demonstrating how depthwise separable convolutions can significantly reduce computational requirements while maintaining accuracy. The YOLOv5 architecture [2] further optimized real-time detection through architectural improvements and training techniques.

#### Oriented Bounding Box Detection

Traditional approaches to oriented object detection include methods based on rotation-invariant features [3] and direct angle regression [4]. Yang et al. [5] introduced KLD-based approaches for high-precision rotated object detection, while Liu et al. [6] proposed FPN-based architectures for oriented object detection in aerial images.

#### Edge Optimization Techniques

Model compression techniques have become essential for edge deployment. Han et al. [7] demonstrated the effectiveness of magnitude-based pruning, while Jacob et al. [8] showed that 8-bit quantization can achieve near-full-precision accuracy with significant speedup. Knowledge distillation [9] provides another avenue for model compression by training smaller student networks to mimic larger teacher models.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

Our system architecture consists of four primary components:

1. **Data Acquisition Module**: Interfaces with the AIY Vision Kit camera system
2. **Detection Engine**: YOLOv5-based oriented bounding box detector
3. **Optimization Framework**: Multi-stage optimization pipeline for edge deployment
4. **Logging and Analysis System**: Comprehensive data collection and performance monitoring

#### 2.1.1 Hardware Platform

The Google AIY Vision Kit provides an ideal testbed for edge AI applications:

- **Processor**: Raspberry Pi Zero W (1GHz ARM11 single-core)
- **Memory**: 512MB LPDDR2 SDRAM
- **Vision Bonnet**: Intel Movidius MA2450 VPU (disabled in our CPU-only implementation)
- **Camera**: Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 (8MP, 1080p30)
- **Storage**: MicroSD card (minimum 16GB)

### 2.2 Oriented Bounding Box Detection

#### 2.2.1 Problem Formulation

For oriented bounding box detection, each object is represented by five parameters:

$$\mathbf{b} = (x_c, y_c, w, h, \theta)$$

where $(x_c, y_c)$ represents the center coordinates, $(w, h)$ are the width and height, and $\theta \in [-90°, 90°]$ is the orientation angle.

The oriented bounding box vertices are computed as:

$$\mathbf{v}_i = \mathbf{R}(\theta) \cdot \mathbf{p}_i + (x_c, y_c)$$

where $\mathbf{R}(\theta)$ is the rotation matrix and $\mathbf{p}_i$ are the local corner coordinates.

#### 2.2.2 YOLOv5-OBB Architecture

Our YOLOv5-OBB architecture extends the standard YOLOv5 detection head to predict oriented bounding boxes:

```
Input: [B, 3, H, W] → Backbone → Neck → Head → [B, A, G_x, G_y, (5+C+1)]
```

where:
- $B$ = batch size
- $A$ = number of anchors per grid cell
- $G_x, G_y$ = grid dimensions
- $5$ = oriented box parameters $(x, y, w, h, \theta)$
- $C$ = number of classes
- $1$ = objectness score

The key modifications include:

1. **Angle Prediction**: Additional output channel for orientation angle
2. **Anchor Modifications**: Orientation-aware anchor generation
3. **Loss Function**: Specialized loss incorporating angular differences

#### 2.2.3 Loss Function Design

Our loss function combines multiple components:

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \lambda_{loc} \mathcal{L}_{loc} + \lambda_{conf} \mathcal{L}_{conf} + \lambda_{cls} \mathcal{L}_{cls} + \lambda_{angle} \mathcal{L}_{angle}$$

where:

**Localization Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{loc} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj} [(x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2 + (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + (\sqrt{w_i} - \sqrt{\hat{w}_i})^2 + (\sqrt{h_i} - \sqrt{\hat{h}_i})^2]$$

**Angular Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{angle} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj} \text{smooth}_{L1}(\theta_i - \hat{\theta}_i)$$

**Confidence Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{conf} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \sum_{j=0}^{B} [\mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj} + \lambda_{noobj} \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{noobj}] (C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2$$

**Classification Loss**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{cls} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \mathbb{1}_{i}^{obj} \sum_{c \in classes} (p_i(c) - \hat{p}_i(c))^2$$

### 2.3 Edge Optimization Framework

#### 2.3.1 Model Quantization

We implement post-training quantization to reduce model size and inference time:

**Dynamic Quantization**: Weights are quantized to INT8 while activations remain FP32 during inference.

**Static Quantization**: Both weights and activations are quantized using calibration data:

$$\mathbf{W}_{quantized} = \text{round}\left(\frac{\mathbf{W}_{float}}{scale} + zero\_point\right)$$

where $scale$ and $zero\_point$ are calibration parameters computed from training data statistics.

#### 2.3.2 Structured Pruning

We apply magnitude-based structured pruning to reduce computational complexity:

$$\text{Importance}(f_i) = \sum_{c=1}^{C} \left\| \mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{i,c} \right\|_2$$

Filters with lowest importance scores are removed, maintaining architectural regularity essential for efficient ARM execution.

#### 2.3.3 Knowledge Distillation

A teacher-student framework compresses model knowledge:

$$\mathcal{L}_{KD} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{task}(y, \sigma(z_s)) + (1-\alpha) T^2 \mathcal{L}_{CE}(\sigma(z_t/T), \sigma(z_s/T))$$

where $z_t$ and $z_s$ are teacher and student logits, $T$ is temperature, and $\sigma$ is the softmax function.

### 2.4 Birds-Eye View Processing

#### 2.4.1 Camera Calibration

Precise camera calibration is essential for accurate BEV detection. We use the standard pinhole camera model:

$$\begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{K} \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{t} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} X \\ Y \\ Z \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

where $\mathbf{K}$ is the intrinsic matrix, $\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$ are rotation and translation parameters.

#### 2.4.2 Perspective Transformation

For aerial applications, we assume a planar world model and apply homographic transformation:

$$\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{K} \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{r}_1 & \mathbf{r}_2 & \mathbf{t} \end{bmatrix}$$

where $\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2$ are the first two columns of the rotation matrix.
